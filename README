For better usage, copy the file to your /bin directory.

Requirements
===============================

- Mac or Linux 
- Python 2.7+

Usage
===============================

Using your terminal, just type:

1) For actions that make changes to hosts file:
   
   $ sudo hosts [param 1] [param 2]
   
   Where [param 1] can be:
       
       -a : Add to hosts
       -r : Remove from hosts
       -c : Comment line
       -u : Uncomment line
       
   and [param 2] can be:
   
       Any URL that you want to manage inside hosts file.
       The only action that needs the full URL is "add" (-a).
       For other actions, you can just specify part of the URL.
       
           i.e.: $ sudo hosts -a www.myurl.com
                 $ sudo hosts -c myurl
                 
       IMPORTANT: "add" (-a) actions automatically adds the URL
                  with and without the "www." prefix, so you can
                  keep smiling. =)
                  Just type one of them, the app handles the rest.
   
2) To list the content of hosts file:

   $ hosts -l
